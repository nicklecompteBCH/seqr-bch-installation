Structure of a family is:

{
    project_id
    family_id
    coll_name
    vcf_file

    individuals:
        indiv_id -> {individual}

}

Where an individual contains:
{
    indiv_id
    has_exome (true/false)
    paternal_id (string, '.' if unknown)
    maternal_id (string, '.' if unknown)
    affected (true/false)
    sex ("1" or "2", 2 is female)
}

A family is uniquely identified by (project_id, family_id) tuple
An indiv_id need only be unique within a family

project_id is required, but it only has to exist; no analyses actually refer to project at a low level;
it's just for organizing similar samples

If you set project_id to '.' for all families, then family_id is a unique id by default

This code is all meant to be readable, not fast. We may need to refactor if it gets CPU-intense
